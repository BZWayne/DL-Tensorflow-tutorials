# DL-Tensorflow-tutorials (based on the book "Learning Tensorflow" by Tom Hope, Yehezhkel S. Resheff & Itay Lieder)

First of all, a clean Python installation, starts with the simple pip installation: 
 $ pip install tensorflow

In common cases, virtualenv used to manage tensorflow
``` 
$ pip install virtualenv
```
In order to work with a virtual environment, we create a folder where we work with them
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir envs
$ virtualenv ~/envs/tensorflow
```
Now we can indicate the activated environment:
```
(tensorflow) $
(tensorflow) $ pip install tensorflow
```
to deactivate this environment use
```
(tensorflow) $ deactivate
```
